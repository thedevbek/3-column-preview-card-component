## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow ... WIP

### What I learned

I've come to realize that it's essential to continue practicing your HTML and CSS skills, even when you're delving into JavaScript or more advanced technologies. It's been a while since I last worked with HTML and CSS, and I've found that although I understand the concepts and what needs to be done, the specifics of how to apply it can be a bit fuzzy. So, the key takeaway is the importance of consistent practice of all skills.


### Continued development

I'm planning to revisit media queries to ensure that my website is responsive. It's important to keep in mind that designing websites with a mobile-first approach is a best practice.
